# Graphics-Project
This project is an OpenGL project. OpenGL’s text rendering features showcase the current time by
updating it continuously dynamically. The analog clock employs OpenGL’s geometric primitives to
draw clock hands, representing hours, minutes, and seconds. These elements are then rotated
following real-time data, offering a traditional yet visually engaging representation of time.
